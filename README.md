# What is an Audit?

An audit is a security focused code review for looking for issues with your code. 

# Help your auditors!

When writing good code, you 100% need to follow these before sending you code to an audit.

-   Add comments
    -   This will help your auditors understand what you're doing.
-   Use [natspec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/natspec-format.html)
    -   Document your functions. DOCUMENT YOUR FUNCTIONS.
-   Test
    -   If you don't have tests, and test coverage of all your functions and lines of code, you shouldn't go to audit. If your tests don't pass, don't go to audit.
-   Be ready to talk to your auditors
    -   The more communication, the better.
-   Be prepared to give them plenty of time.
    -   They literally pour themselves over your code.

# Process

An auditors process looks like this:

1. Run tests
2. Read specs/docs
3. Run fast tools (like slither, linters, static analysis, etc)
4. Manual Analysis
5. Run slow tools (like echidna, manticore, symbolic execution, MythX)
6. Discuss (and repeat steps as needed)
7. Write report ([Example report](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/tree/main/audits))

Typically, you organize reports in a chart that looks like this:

# Usage
## Slither 

Open the docker shell:

```
yarn toolbox
```

Then, run:

```
slither /src/contracts/ --solc-remaps @openzeppelin=/src/node_modules/@openzeppelin --exclude naming-convention,external-function,low-level-calls
```

To exit:

```
exit
```


## Echidna

Open the docker shell:

```
yarn toolbox
```

Then, run this:

echidna-test /src/contracts/test/fuzzing/VaultFuzzTest.sol --contract VaultFuzzTest --config /src/contracts/test/fuzzing/config.yaml
```

To exit:

```
exit
```

# Linting

To check linting / code formatting:

```
yarn lint
```
